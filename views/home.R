    #       Arena3D<sup>web</sup> is the first, fully interactive and dependency-free, web application which allows the
    #       visualization of multi-layered graphs in 3D space. With Arena3D<sup>web</sup>, users can integrate multiple networks
    #       in a single view along with their intra- and inter-layer connections. For clearer and more informative views, users
    #       can choose between a plethora of layout algorithms and apply them on a set of selected layers either individually or
    #       in combination. Users can align networks and highlight node topological features, whereas each layer as well as the
    #       whole scene can be translated, rotated and scaled in 3D space. User-selected edge colors can be used to highlight
    #       important paths, while node positioning, coloring and resizing can be adjusted on-the-fly. In its current version,
    #       Arena3D<sup>web</sup> supports weighted and unweighted undirected graphs, is written in R, Shiny and Javascript.
